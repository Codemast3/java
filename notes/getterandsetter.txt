Getters and Setters are used to effectively
 protect
 your data, particularly
 when creating classes. For each variable,
 the get method returns its value,
 while the set method sets the value.



''
Example:
public class Vehicle {
  private String color;

  // Getter
  public String getColor() {
    return color;
  }

 // Setter
  public void setColor(String c) {
    this.color = c;
  }
} ''
// getter start with get followed by
 the variable name //
 //setters start with set ,followed by the variable name,
 with the first letter of the variable name capitalized
